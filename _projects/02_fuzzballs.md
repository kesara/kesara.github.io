[Fuzz ball][fuzzball] is an open source VST audio plugin that provides fuzz
effects. The plug is written in [Rust][rust] programming language.

Currently it's only available for MacOS because of dependency limitations. :(

[This Soundcloud album][fuzzball-soundcloud] has [Fuzz Ball][fuzzball] VST
audio plugin demos.
