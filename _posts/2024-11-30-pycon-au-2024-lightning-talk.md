Here's my lightning talk from [PyCon AU 2024][pyconau] that was held in Narrm
(Melbourne), Australia this year.
The speech is about writing your an [Internet-Draft](i-d) and how [RFC][rfc]s
are generated.
This was my second lightning talk of the conference, I gave another talk a day
before in DevOops (not a typo) specialized track. I was bit more prepared for
this talk. I made the presentation and example draft in early of lighting talk
day and did some adjustments up until the last few hours.

The [PyCon AU 2024][pyconau] had lightning talks threee different days (Friday
on specialized DevOops tack, Saturday and Sunday). PyCon AU was highly
educational and entreating. There were lots of [interesting talks][talks], I
highly recommend watching the talks and attending future PyCon AUs.
