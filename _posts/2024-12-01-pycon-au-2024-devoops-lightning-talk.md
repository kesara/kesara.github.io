Here's my first lightning talk from [PyCon AU 2024][pyconau] that was held in
Narrm (Melbourne), Australia this year.
This was given in the DevOops (not a typo) specialized track. I also gave
[another lightning talk][lightningtalk] (much more prepared than this) on very
next day in the main conference.
This speech is about the unforeseen issues caused by following best practices
with docker in production deployments. This was an unprepared talk, I didn't
practice it all and it was spur of the moment thing to submit the talk.
I didn't have any presentation slides but since all other speakers had on I
created landing slide to fill the space, just couple of talks before mine. :)

The [PyCon AU 2024][pyconau] had lightning talks threee different days (Friday
on specialized DevOops tack, Saturday and Sunday). PyCon AU was highly
educational and entreating. There were lots of [interesting talks][talks], I
highly recommend watching the talks and attending future PyCon AUs.
