I was managed to release a new version of [Deep Dreamer][deepdreamer]
yesterday. It's been a while since I worked on Deep Dreamer project mainly
since lack of good enough hardware to generate images fast enough.

Lot has been changed on it's main dependency Caffee since Deep Dreamer's last
update. This release [0.0.2a](release) is all about making sure it works with
Caffee 1.0.0 and Python 3. This release will not work under Python 2.7.
