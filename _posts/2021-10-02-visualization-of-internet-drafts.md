[IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force)][ietf] is a non-profit standards
organization that develops and promotes technical standards related to the
internet.
[Visualize IETF][visualize-ietf] project is an attempt to visually present
how different [areas][ietf-areas] have evolved and how authors have
contributed to Internet-Drafts (IDs) over time.
Visualizations were created using [Gsource][gsource].

I have published all the visualizations that I created under this [YouTube
Playlist][playlist].
The source code of the project is hosted in GitHub under
[Visualize IETF][visualize-ietf].

Here's a sample visualization of how IDs were authored from January 2021 to
July 2021, This is clustered by [areas][ietf-areas] and [working groups][ietf-wg]
that belong to the area.

This project was created as a part of the [IETF 111][ietf-111] hackathon.
Here's my presentation at the hackathon.
